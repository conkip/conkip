## Hello

My name is Connor Kippes, and I'm a backend developer at IBM.<br>

Mostly working with <img width="20" height="20" alt="java_icon" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c3371ea-b6cf-4e56-ae00-3f113329c2d1" /> Java and <img width="20" height="20" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5500ab4-1435-4271-8715-7f253573449b" /> Python.

Though I also enjoy working on websites with <img width="22" height="20" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/04317e6b-c992-4e9c-a896-9bb67ffa529e" /> React and <img width="20" height="20" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/93a320f1-6bb5-4ee5-a78f-0e9f5e3d31d1" />
Typescript on the side. <br>
